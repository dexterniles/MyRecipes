# PrepSync Security Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in PrepSync to protect user data and prevent common attacks.

---

## Security Features

### 1. Password Policy

#### Requirements:
- **Minimum Length:** 8 characters
- **Complexity:** Must contain:
  - At least one uppercase letter (A-Z)
  - At least one lowercase letter (a-z)
  - At least one number (0-9)

#### Recommended:
- Use 12+ characters for better security
- Include special characters (!@#$%^&*)
- Use unique passwords for each service
- Never reuse passwords

#### Validation:
- **Client-side:** Real-time validation with strength indicator
- **Server-side:** Joi schema validation before processing

---

### 2. Rate Limiting

#### Protection Against:
- Brute force attacks
- DDoS attacks
- API abuse

#### Limits:
- **General API:** 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- **Login:** 5 attempts per 15 minutes per IP
- **Registration:** 10 attempts per hour per IP

#### Implementation:
Uses `express-rate-limit` middleware with configurable windows.

---

### 3. Input Sanitization

#### Protection Against:
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- HTML injection
- Script injection
- URL manipulation

#### Sanitization Methods:
- HTML entity encoding
- Email validation
- URL validation
- Array sanitization

#### Usage:
All user inputs are sanitized before:
- Storing in database
- Displaying in UI
- Processing in API

---

### 4. HTTPS Enforcement

#### In Production:
- All HTTP requests are automatically redirected to HTTPS
- Strict Transport Security (HSTS) enabled
- 1-year max age with includeSubDomains

#### Benefits:
- Encrypted data transmission
- Prevents man-in-the-middle attacks
- Protects credentials in transit

---

### 5. Security Headers

#### Implemented Headers:
- **X-Content-Type-Options:** nosniff
  - Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **X-Frame-Options:** DENY
  - Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **X-XSS-Protection:** 1
  - Enables browser XSS filter
- **Referrer-Policy:** strict-origin-when-cross-origin
  - Limits referrer information leakage
- **Permissions-Policy:** 
  - Blocks camera, microphone, geolocation access

#### Implementation:
Using Helmet.js with custom configuration.

---

### 6. JWT Authentication

#### Token Security:
- Tokens expire after 7 days
- Secret key stored in environment variables
- Minimum 32 characters for JWT_SECRET
- No default/fallback secret keys

#### Token Storage:
- Stored in localStorage
- **Note:** Consider httpOnly cookies for enhanced security

#### Best Practices:
- Tokens validated on every request
- Expired tokens automatically rejected
- Logout clears token from storage

---

### 7. Database Security

#### Connection Security:
- Connection pooling for efficiency
- Proper error handling and cleanup
- SSL/TLS encryption for database connections

#### Query Security:
- Parameterized queries prevent SQL injection
- No raw SQL concatenation
- Proper escaping of user inputs

---

## Token Storage Security

### Current Implementation:
- **Storage:** localStorage
- **Risk:** Vulnerable to XSS attacks

### Recommendations:
1. **Short-term:** Current implementation is acceptable with XSS protection via sanitization
2. **Long-term:** Consider migrating to httpOnly cookies with CSRF tokens

### XSS Protection:
- All user inputs are sanitized before rendering
- HTML entity encoding applied to user content
- No dangerous HTML allowed in user-generated content

---

## Environment Variables

### Required Variables:
```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-min-32-characters
```

### Optional Variables:
```bash
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=production
CORS_ORIGIN=https://yourdomain.com
```

### Security Notes:
- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- Use strong, random JWT_SECRET (minimum 32 characters)
- Rotate JWT_SECRET periodically in production
- Use different secrets for staging and production

---

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers:
1. **Never log sensitive data** (passwords, tokens, etc.)
2. **Validate all inputs** at both client and server
3. **Keep dependencies updated** (`npm audit`)
4. **Review security headers** regularly
5. **Test security measures** before deployment

### For Users:
1. **Use strong passwords** (12+ characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
2. **Never share credentials**
3. **Log out when finished**
4. **Report suspicious activity** immediately

---

## Security Incident Response

### If You Suspect a Breach:
1. **Immediately change your password**
2. **Check for unauthorized access**
3. **Contact support** with details
4. **Monitor for suspicious activity**

### For Administrators:
1. **Review server logs** for suspicious activity
2. **Check for unauthorized access**
3. **Rotate credentials** if necessary
4. **Monitor for unusual patterns**

---

## Compliance

### Data Protection:
- User passwords are hashed using bcrypt (12 rounds)
- Sensitive data encrypted in transit (HTTPS)
- No sensitive data logged

### Privacy:
- User data only accessible to authenticated users
- No third-party data sharing
- GDPR considerations in place

---

## Future Security Enhancements

### Planned (Stage 2+):
- [ ] CSRF protection implementation
- [ ] Two-factor authentication (2FA)
- [ ] Session management improvements
- [ ] Advanced intrusion detection
- [ ] Security audit logging

### Under Consideration:
- [ ] OAuth integration
- [ ] Biometric authentication
- [ ] Passwordless authentication
- [ ] Advanced rate limiting strategies

---

## Reporting Security Issues

### Responsible Disclosure:
If you discover a security vulnerability, please:
1. **Do not** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email security@yourdomain.com with details
3. Allow reasonable time for fix before disclosure

### What to Include:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)
